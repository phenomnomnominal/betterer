/**
 * Renderer used within {@link https://github.com/phenomnomnominal/betterer | **Betterer**}.
 *
 * Problems happen when there are multiple versions of `react` available within a codebase,
 * as different instances of the `ink` renderer may find different versions of `react-dom`.
 *
 * This package is an attempt to ensure that `ink` always finds the same version of
 * `react` and `react-dom`
 *
 * 🚨 THIS PACKAGE SHOULD ONLY BE USED WITHIN THE BETTERER MONOREPO 🚨
